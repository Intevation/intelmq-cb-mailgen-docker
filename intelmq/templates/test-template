Dear Sir or Madam,

Each record includes the IP address of the affected system, a timestamp
and the name of the related malware family. If available, the record

hostname for the connection most probably triggered by the malware
to connect to a command-and-control server.

We would like to ask you to check the issues reported and to take
appropriate steps to get the infected hosts cleaned up or notify
your customers accordingly.
